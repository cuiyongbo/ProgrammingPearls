Q: I try to build an image with `docker build -f tritonserver/deployment/Dockerfile`, and in the Dockerfile, there is a command `ADD ./assets /build/`, does the command mean the path of `assets`` is `root_path/tritonserver/deployment/assets` or `root_path/assets`

The `ADD` command in a Dockerfile can sometimes be a bit confusing when it comes to understanding the context of relative paths. To clarify, let’s break down how the `ADD` command works and determine what the path should be in your specific case.

### Understanding the `ADD` Command

The `ADD` command in a Dockerfile copies files, directories, or remote URLs from a source location on your host machine to a destination location in the Docker image's filesystem.

#### Syntax:
```dockerfile
ADD <source> <destination>
```

### Relative Path Context

When using relative paths in the `ADD` command, the context for those paths is the directory where the `docker build` command is executed. This directory is known as the "build context."

### Example Setup

Given your command:
```bash
docker build -f tritonserver/deployment/Dockerfile .
```

- `-f tritonserver/deployment/Dockerfile` specifies the path to the Dockerfile relative to the build context.
- The `.` at the end specifies the build context, which in this case is the current directory from which the `docker build` command is run.

### The `ADD` Directive

In your Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
ADD ./assets /build/
```

Here, `./assets` is a relative path. Since relative paths in a Dockerfile are interpreted relative to the build context, we need to understand the context:

- If you run the `docker build` command from `root_path`, the build context is `root_path`.
- `ADD ./assets /build/` will look for the `assets` directory in the `root_path`.

### Concrete Example

Assume the following directory structure:

```
root_path
│
├── assets
│   ├── file1
│   ├── file2
│
├── tritonserver
│   └── deployment
│       └── Dockerfile
│
└── other_files
```

1. You run the build command from `root_path`:
   ```bash
   docker build -f tritonserver/deployment/Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Since the build context is `root_path`, the `ADD ./assets /build/` command will look for `assets` inside `root_path`.

3. Thus, `./assets` refers to `root_path/assets`.

### Summary

In your example, when you run the command:
```bash
docker build -f tritonserver/deployment/Dockerfile .
```
and your Dockerfile contains:
```dockerfile
ADD ./assets /build/
```
the `./assets` path refers to `root_path/assets`.

### Additional Tips

- **Absolute vs Relative Paths**: Using absolute paths in the Dockerfile can prevent ambiguity but is generally avoided since the build context should be portable.
- **Build Context**: Always ensure that the paths you include in `ADD` or `COPY` directives in your Dockerfile are relative to the build context. The build context is what’s passed as the last argument to `docker build`.

By carefully structuring your Dockerfile and understanding the context of your `docker build` command, you can avoid path-related issues and ensure that all necessary files are correctly added to your Docker image.
