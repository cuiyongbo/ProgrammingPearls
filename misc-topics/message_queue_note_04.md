Q: when pulishing a message to kafka, would kafka append a timestamp to the message?

Yes, when publishing a message to Kafka, Kafka can append a timestamp to the message. This timestamp can be used for various purposes, such as tracking when the message was produced or when it was received by the broker.

### Types of Timestamps

Kafka supports two types of timestamps for messages:

1. **Create Time (LogAppendTime)**: This is the time when the producer created the message.
2. **Log Append Time**: This is the time when the Kafka broker received the message and appended it to the log.

### How Timestamps Work

- **Producer Timestamp (Create Time)**: By default, the producer sets the timestamp when it creates the message. This timestamp is then sent along with the message to the Kafka broker.
- **Broker Timestamp (Log Append Time)**: If the broker is configured to use log append time, it will overwrite the producer's timestamp with the time when the message is appended to the log.

### Configuration

- **Producer Configuration**: The producer can set the timestamp for each message. By default, the producer uses the current system time as the timestamp.
- **Broker Configuration**: The broker can be configured to use either the producer's timestamp or the broker's log append time. This is controlled by the `log.message.timestamp.type` configuration parameter.

### Example Configuration

#### Producer Configuration

In the producer, you don't need to explicitly set the timestamp unless you want to use a custom timestamp. By default, the producer will use the current system time.

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("my-topic", "key", "value");
producer.send(record);
```

#### Broker Configuration

In the broker configuration (`server.properties`), you can set the `log.message.timestamp.type` parameter to either `CreateTime` or `LogAppendTime`.

```properties
# Use the producer's timestamp
log.message.timestamp.type=CreateTime

# Use the broker's log append time
# log.message.timestamp.type=LogAppendTime
```

### Accessing Timestamps

When consuming messages, you can access the timestamp using the `ConsumerRecord` class.

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("group.id", "my-group");
props.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
props.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("my-topic"));

while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        System.out.printf("offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s, timestamp = %d%n",
                          record.offset(), record.key(), record.value(), record.timestamp());
    }
}
```

### Summary

- Kafka can append a timestamp to each message.
- The timestamp can be set by the producer (Create Time) or by the broker (Log Append Time).
- The broker's behavior is controlled by the `log.message.timestamp.type` configuration parameter.
- Consumers can access the timestamp using the `ConsumerRecord` class.

By understanding and configuring these options, you can effectively manage and utilize timestamps in your Kafka messages.

Q: how to add custom timestamp when publishing a message to kafka?

To add a custom timestamp when publishing a message to Kafka, you can use the `ProducerRecord` constructor that allows you to specify the timestamp. This is useful if you want to set a specific timestamp rather than relying on the default system time.

### Example in Java

Here's an example of how to set a custom timestamp when publishing a message using the Kafka Java client:

1. **Add Kafka Dependencies**: Ensure you have the Kafka client library in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
        <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
        <version>2.8.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. **Producer Configuration**: Configure the Kafka producer.

    ```java
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
    import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

    import java.util.Properties;

    public class CustomTimestampProducer {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
            props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
            props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());

            KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

            String topic = "my-topic";
            String key = "key";
            String value = "value";
            long customTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() - 10000; // Custom timestamp (10 seconds ago)

            ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, null, customTimestamp, key, value);

            producer.send(record, (metadata, exception) -> {
                if (exception == null) {
                    System.out.printf("Sent record with custom timestamp: %d%n", customTimestamp);
                } else {
                    exception.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            producer.close();
        }
    }
    ```

### Explanation

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the Kafka client library in your project.
2. **Producer Configuration**: Set up the producer properties, including the bootstrap servers and serializers for the key and value.
3. **Custom Timestamp**: Create a `ProducerRecord` with a custom timestamp. The constructor used here is:
    ```java
    ProducerRecord(String topic, Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V value)
    ```
    - `topic`: The topic to which the record will be sent.
    - `partition`: The partition to which the record will be sent (can be `null` to let Kafka decide).
    - `timestamp`: The custom timestamp you want to set.
    - `key`: The key of the record.
    - `value`: The value of the record.
4. **Send Record**: Send the record using the `send` method of the producer. The callback function logs the success or failure of the send operation.
5. **Close Producer**: Close the producer to release resources.

### Summary

By using the appropriate `ProducerRecord` constructor, you can set a custom timestamp for each message you publish to Kafka. This allows you to control the timestamp metadata associated with your messages, which can be useful for various application-specific requirements.

Q: what happens if I set timestamp of a message to one month ago, essentially older than configured retention period of kafka?

If you set the timestamp of a message to a value that is older than the configured retention period of the Kafka topic, the message may be immediately eligible for deletion based on the retention policy. Kafka's retention policy can be configured based on time or size, and it determines how long messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted.

### Key Points

1. **Retention Period**: Kafka topics have a retention period configured via the `retention.ms` property. This property specifies the maximum time that messages are retained in the topic.
2. **Log Cleanup**: Kafka periodically checks the log segments to see if they contain messages that are older than the retention period and deletes those segments.

### Scenario

- **Retention Period**: Suppose the retention period for a topic is set to 7 days (`retention.ms=604800000`).
- **Message Timestamp**: You publish a message with a timestamp that is one month old.

### What Happens

1. **Message Insertion**: When you publish the message with the old timestamp, Kafka will accept the message and append it to the log.
2. **Log Cleanup**: During the next log cleanup cycle, Kafka will check the timestamps of the messages in the log segments.
3. **Message Deletion**: Since the message's timestamp is older than the retention period (7 days), Kafka will consider the message as expired and eligible for deletion. The log segment containing the message may be deleted immediately or during the next cleanup cycle.

### Example Configuration

#### Topic Configuration

```bash
# Set the retention period to 7 days (in milliseconds)
bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic --config retention.ms=604800000
```

#### Producer Code

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

import java.util.Properties;

public class CustomTimestampProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

        String topic = "my-topic";
        String key = "key";
        String value = "value";
        long customTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() - (30L * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Custom timestamp (30 days ago)

        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, null, customTimestamp, key, value);

        producer.send(record, (metadata, exception) -> {
            if (exception == null) {
                System.out.printf("Sent record with custom timestamp: %d%n", customTimestamp);
            } else {
                exception.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        producer.close();
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Immediate Deletion**: If the message's timestamp is older than the retention period, it will be eligible for deletion during the next log cleanup cycle.
- **Retention Policy**: Ensure that the retention policy aligns with your use case, especially if you are setting custom timestamps.
- **Log Cleanup Cycle**: Kafka periodically checks and deletes expired messages based on the configured retention policy.

By understanding how Kafka's retention policy works with message timestamps, you can better manage the lifecycle of your messages and ensure that important data is retained as needed.

Q: what if I set the timestamp to a future date?

If you set the timestamp of a Kafka message to a future date, the message will be treated as if it was produced at that future time. This can have several implications, particularly in how the message is handled by consumers and retention policies.

### Key Points

1. **Message Insertion**: Kafka will accept the message with the future timestamp and append it to the log.
2. **Retention Policy**: The retention policy based on time (`retention.ms`) will not immediately affect this message, as it is not considered "old" until the future date is reached.
3. **Consumers**: Consumers that rely on message timestamps for processing logic may behave unexpectedly if they encounter messages with future timestamps.

### Implications

1. **Retention**: The message will not be eligible for deletion based on the time-based retention policy until the future timestamp plus the retention period is reached. This means the message will stay in the log longer than other messages with current or past timestamps.
2. **Consumer Behavior**: If consumers use the message timestamp for ordering or processing logic, they may encounter issues. For example, if a consumer processes messages based on their timestamps, it might process the future-dated message out of order or delay processing until the future date is reached.
3. **Time-Based Queries**: If you use Kafka Streams or other tools that perform time-based queries or windowing operations, the future-dated message might be included in future windows, potentially causing incorrect results.

### Example Configuration

#### Producer Code

Here's an example of how to set a future timestamp when publishing a message using the Kafka Java client:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;

import java.util.Properties;

public class FutureTimestampProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

        String topic = "my-topic";
        String key = "key";
        String value = "value";
        long futureTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() + (7L * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Custom timestamp (7 days in the future)

        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, null, futureTimestamp, key, value);

        producer.send(record, (metadata, exception) -> {
            if (exception == null) {
                System.out.printf("Sent record with future timestamp: %d%n", futureTimestamp);
            } else {
                exception.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        producer.close();
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Message Insertion**: Kafka will accept messages with future timestamps.
- **Retention Policy**: The message will not be eligible for deletion based on the time-based retention policy until the future timestamp plus the retention period is reached.
- **Consumer Behavior**: Consumers may encounter issues if they rely on timestamps for processing logic.
- **Time-Based Queries**: Future-dated messages can affect time-based queries and windowing operations.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid Future Timestamps**: Generally, it's best to avoid setting future timestamps unless you have a specific use case that requires it.
- **Consumer Logic**: Ensure that your consumers can handle messages with future timestamps appropriately.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor your Kafka topics and consumer behavior to ensure that future-dated messages do not cause unexpected issues.

By understanding the implications of setting future timestamps, you can better manage your Kafka message lifecycle and ensure that your consumers process messages correctly.
