Q: what happens if there is hash collision when using std::unordered_map?

When using `std::unordered_map` in C++, a hash collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value. The `std::unordered_map` handles hash collisions internally using a technique called chaining, which involves storing multiple elements in the same bucket.

### How `std::unordered_map` Handles Hash Collisions

1. **Buckets**: The `std::unordered_map` is implemented as an array of buckets. Each bucket can store multiple elements that have the same hash value.
2. **Chaining**: When a hash collision occurs, the elements with the same hash value are stored in a linked list (or another container) within the same bucket.
3. **Insertion**: When inserting an element, the `std::unordered_map` computes the hash value of the key and places the element in the corresponding bucket. If the bucket already contains elements (due to a collision), the new element is added to the list of elements in that bucket.
4. **Lookup**: When looking up an element, the `std::unordered_map` computes the hash value of the key to find the appropriate bucket. It then searches through the list of elements in that bucket to find the element with the matching key.

### Example

Here is an example to illustrate how `std::unordered_map` handles hash collisions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string> my_map;

    // Insert elements into the unordered_map
    my_map[1] = "One";
    my_map[2] = "Two";
    my_map[3] = "Three";

    // Force a hash collision by using a custom hash function (for illustration purposes)
    struct CustomHash {
        std::size_t operator()(int key) const {
            return key % 2; // Simple hash function that causes collisions
        }
    };

    std::unordered_map<int, std::string, CustomHash> custom_map;
    custom_map[1] = "One";
    custom_map[2] = "Two";
    custom_map[3] = "Three";

    // Print elements in the custom_map
    for (const auto& pair : custom_map) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Standard `std::unordered_map`**: The `my_map` uses the default hash function, which minimizes collisions.
2. **Custom Hash Function**: The `custom_map` uses a custom hash function that intentionally causes collisions by returning the same hash value for keys that are even and odd.
3. **Insertion and Lookup**: Despite the collisions, the `std::unordered_map` handles them by storing colliding elements in the same bucket and using chaining to manage them.

### Performance Implications

- **Average Case**: In the average case, `std::unordered_map` provides constant time complexity, \(O(1)\), for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
- **Worst Case**: In the worst case, if many collisions occur and all elements end up in the same bucket, the time complexity can degrade to \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the map. This is because the operations would require searching through a list of elements in the bucket.

### Conclusion

`std::unordered_map` handles hash collisions using chaining, which allows multiple elements to be stored in the same bucket. While collisions can affect performance, the average case remains efficient with constant time complexity. Properly designed hash functions can minimize collisions and maintain the performance benefits of `std::unordered_map`.


Q: what if there are many hash collisions? what std does to migrate the effect on insertion and searching

When there are many hash collisions in a `std::unordered_map`, the performance of insertion and searching operations can degrade because multiple elements are stored in the same bucket, leading to longer chains that need to be traversed. To mitigate the effects of hash collisions, the C++ Standard Library employs several strategies:

### Strategies to Mitigate Hash Collisions

1. **Rehashing**:
   - **Automatic Rehashing**: `std::unordered_map` automatically rehashes its elements when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold. The load factor is defined as the number of elements divided by the number of buckets.
   - **Load Factor**: By default, the maximum load factor is 1.0, but it can be adjusted using the `max_load_factor` method. When the load factor exceeds this threshold, the number of buckets is increased, and all elements are rehashed and redistributed into the new buckets.
   - **Rehash Method**: You can manually trigger rehashing by calling the `rehash` method, specifying the new number of buckets.

2. **Choosing a Good Hash Function**:
   - **Default Hash Function**: The default hash function provided by `std::unordered_map` is generally well-suited for most use cases. However, for custom types or specific scenarios, you can provide a custom hash function that distributes keys more uniformly.
   - **Custom Hash Function**: Implementing a custom hash function can help reduce collisions by ensuring a more uniform distribution of hash values.

3. **Bucket Size Management**:
   - **Reserve Buckets**: You can reserve a specific number of buckets in advance using the `reserve` method. This can help reduce the number of rehashing operations if you have an estimate of the number of elements that will be inserted.

### Example: Rehashing and Custom Hash Function

Here is an example demonstrating how to use rehashing and a custom hash function to mitigate the effects of hash collisions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

// Custom hash function
struct CustomHash {
    std::size_t operator()(int key) const {
        // Simple hash function that reduces collisions
        return std::hash<int>()(key) ^ (key << 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string, CustomHash> my_map;

    // Insert elements into the unordered_map
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        my_map[i] = "Value" + std::to_string(i);
    }

    // Print the load factor and number of buckets
    std::cout << "Load factor: " << my_map.load_factor() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of buckets: " << my_map.bucket_count() << std::endl;

    // Rehash to increase the number of buckets
    my_map.rehash(200);

    // Print the load factor and number of buckets after rehashing
    std::cout << "Load factor after rehashing: " << my_map.load_factor() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of buckets after rehashing: " << my_map.bucket_count() << std::endl;

    // Access elements to demonstrate that they are still accessible
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Key: " << i << ", Value: " << my_map[i] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Custom Hash Function**: The `CustomHash` struct defines a custom hash function that aims to reduce collisions by combining the default hash with a bitwise shift.
2. **Insert Elements**: The example inserts 100 elements into the `unordered_map`.
3. **Load Factor and Buckets**: The load factor and number of buckets are printed before and after rehashing.
4. **Rehashing**: The `rehash` method is called to increase the number of buckets to 200, which helps distribute the elements more evenly and reduce collisions.

### Summary

- **Rehashing**: Automatically or manually rehashing elements when the load factor exceeds a threshold helps distribute elements more evenly across buckets.
- **Custom Hash Function**: Implementing a custom hash function can reduce collisions by ensuring a more uniform distribution of hash values.
- **Bucket Management**: Reserving buckets in advance can reduce the number of rehashing operations and improve performance.

By employing these strategies, `std::unordered_map` can effectively mitigate the impact of hash collisions and maintain efficient performance for insertion and searching operations.

Q: how large should I set `std::unordered_map::max_load_factor` usually?

The `max_load_factor` of a `std::unordered_map` in C++ determines the maximum average number of elements per bucket before the container automatically increases the number of buckets and rehashes the elements. The default `max_load_factor` is typically set to 1.0, which means that on average, there will be one element per bucket.

### Considerations for Setting `max_load_factor`

1. **Performance Trade-offs**:
   - **Lower Load Factor**: A lower `max_load_factor` (e.g., 0.5) means more buckets and fewer elements per bucket, which can reduce the likelihood of collisions and improve lookup and insertion performance. However, it also increases memory usage because more buckets are allocated.
   - **Higher Load Factor**: A higher `max_load_factor` (e.g., 2.0) means fewer buckets and more elements per bucket, which can save memory but may increase the likelihood of collisions, potentially degrading performance for lookups and insertions.

2. **Typical Use Cases**:
   - **Default Setting**: For most use cases, the default `max_load_factor` of 1.0 is a good balance between performance and memory usage.
   - **High-Performance Requirements**: If your application requires very fast lookups and insertions and can afford higher memory usage, you might consider setting a lower `max_load_factor` (e.g., 0.5).
   - **Memory-Constrained Environments**: If memory usage is a concern and you can tolerate slightly slower performance, you might consider setting a higher `max_load_factor` (e.g., 1.5 or 2.0).

### Example of Setting `max_load_factor`

Here is an example of how to set the `max_load_factor` for an `std::unordered_map`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string> my_map;

    // Set the max load factor
    my_map.max_load_factor(0.75);

    // Insert elements into the unordered_map
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        my_map[i] = "Value" + std::to_string(i);
    }

    // Print the load factor and number of buckets
    std::cout << "Load factor: " << my_map.load_factor() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max load factor: " << my_map.max_load_factor() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of buckets: " << my_map.bucket_count() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Set `max_load_factor`**: The `max_load_factor` is set to 0.75 using the `max_load_factor` method.
2. **Insert Elements**: Elements are inserted into the `unordered_map`.
3. **Print Load Factor and Buckets**: The current load factor, maximum load factor, and number of buckets are printed to show the effect of the setting.

### Summary

- **Default Setting**: The default `max_load_factor` of 1.0 is generally suitable for most applications.
- **Lower Load Factor**: Consider a lower `max_load_factor` (e.g., 0.5) for high-performance requirements where memory usage is less of a concern.
- **Higher Load Factor**: Consider a higher `max_load_factor` (e.g., 1.5 or 2.0) for memory-constrained environments where slightly slower performance is acceptable.

Ultimately, the optimal `max_load_factor` depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. You may need to experiment with different values and measure the performance and memory usage to find the best balance for your use case.
