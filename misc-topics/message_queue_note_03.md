Q: when we have multiple consumers subscribing a kafka topic, for example 3 consumers, what happens if 2 consumers succeeded in acknowledging a message, but one consumer crashed while processing it? would kafka remove the message from its queue?

In Apache Kafka, the behavior of message acknowledgment and processing is governed by the concept of consumer groups. When multiple consumers subscribe to a Kafka topic as part of the same consumer group, Kafka ensures that each partition of the topic is consumed by only one consumer in the group at a time. This means that each message is processed by only one consumer within the group.

### Key Points to Understand:

1. **Consumer Groups**: Consumers that are part of the same consumer group share the work of consuming messages from the topic. Each partition is assigned to only one consumer in the group.
2. **Message Acknowledgment**: Kafka uses offsets to track which messages have been consumed. Consumers periodically commit their offsets to Kafka to acknowledge that they have successfully processed messages up to a certain point.
3. **Failure Handling**: If a consumer crashes or fails to process a message, Kafka does not automatically remove the message from the queue. Instead, the message remains in the partition, and the consumer's offset is not updated.

### Scenario: Multiple Consumers in a Consumer Group

Let's consider a scenario where you have 3 consumers (C1, C2, and C3) in a consumer group, all consuming from the same topic with multiple partitions.

1. **Message Distribution**: Kafka distributes the partitions among the consumers. For example, if the topic has 3 partitions (P0, P1, P2), each consumer might be assigned one partition.
   - C1 -> P0
   - C2 -> P1
   - C3 -> P2

2. **Message Processing**: Each consumer processes messages from its assigned partition and periodically commits its offsets to Kafka.

3. **Consumer Failure**: If one consumer (e.g., C3) crashes while processing a message, the following happens:
   - The message that C3 was processing is not acknowledged because C3 did not commit the offset.
   - Kafka detects that C3 has crashed (through heartbeats and session timeouts).
   - Kafka rebalances the partitions among the remaining consumers (C1 and C2). One of them will be assigned the partition that C3 was consuming (P2).

4. **Reprocessing**: The new consumer assigned to P2 (let's say C1) will start consuming from the last committed offset for that partition. This means that the message that C3 was processing will be reprocessed by C1.

### Example Workflow

1. **Initial Assignment**:
   - C1 -> P0
   - C2 -> P1
   - C3 -> P2

2. **Message Processing**:
   - C1 processes and commits offsets for P0.
   - C2 processes and commits offsets for P1.
   - C3 processes a message from P2 but crashes before committing the offset.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Kafka detects the failure of C3.
   - Kafka reassigns P2 to C1 or C2 (let's assume C1).

4. **Reprocessing**:
   - C1 starts consuming from the last committed offset for P2.
   - The message that C3 was processing is reprocessed by C1.

### Summary

- **Consumer Groups**: Ensure that each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group at a time.
- **Message Acknowledgment**: Consumers commit offsets to acknowledge processed messages.
- **Failure Handling**: If a consumer crashes, the message it was processing is not acknowledged, and the partition is reassigned to another consumer in the group.
- **Reprocessing**: The new consumer assigned to the partition will reprocess the message from the last committed offset.

In summary, Kafka does not remove the message from the queue if a consumer crashes while processing it. Instead, the message remains in the partition, and another consumer will reprocess it after rebalancing. This ensures that messages are not lost and are eventually processed.

Q: in my case all consumers would consume all the partitions of a topic, so what happens if some consumer crashed before committing the offset to borker while processing a message?

In the scenario where all consumers are set up to consume all partitions of a topic, it sounds like you are using multiple consumers in a way that each consumer is independently consuming the entire topic. This is different from the typical use case of consumer groups where partitions are divided among consumers.

However, if you are indeed using consumer groups and each consumer is part of the same group, then each partition will be assigned to only one consumer at a time. Let's clarify both scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Independent Consumers (Not in a Consumer Group)

If each consumer is independently consuming all partitions of a topic (i.e., they are not part of the same consumer group), then each consumer will maintain its own offset for each partition. In this case:

1. **Message Processing**: Each consumer processes messages independently and maintains its own offset.
2. **Consumer Failure**: If a consumer crashes before committing the offset:
   - The other consumers are unaffected because they maintain their own offsets.
   - The crashed consumer, upon restart, will resume consuming from the last committed offset, potentially reprocessing some messages.

### Scenario 2: Consumers in a Consumer Group

If all consumers are part of the same consumer group, then Kafka will assign partitions to consumers such that each partition is consumed by only one consumer at a time. In this case:

1. **Message Processing**: Each consumer processes messages from its assigned partitions and commits offsets to Kafka.
2. **Consumer Failure**: If a consumer crashes before committing the offset:
   - Kafka detects the failure through heartbeats and session timeouts.
   - Kafka rebalances the partitions among the remaining consumers in the group.
   - The new consumer assigned to the partition will start consuming from the last committed offset, reprocessing any uncommitted messages.

### Detailed Explanation for Consumer Groups

1. **Initial Assignment**:
   - Assume you have 3 consumers (C1, C2, C3) in a consumer group and a topic with 3 partitions (P0, P1, P2).
   - Kafka assigns partitions to consumers:
     - C1 -> P0
     - C2 -> P1
     - C3 -> P2

2. **Message Processing**:
   - Each consumer processes messages from its assigned partition and periodically commits offsets to Kafka.

3. **Consumer Failure**:
   - If C3 crashes while processing a message from P2 and before committing the offset:
     - The message is not acknowledged because the offset was not committed.
     - Kafka detects the failure of C3 through heartbeats and session timeouts.
     - Kafka rebalances the partitions among the remaining consumers (C1 and C2).

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Kafka reassigns P2 to one of the remaining consumers (let's assume C1).
   - C1 now consumes from both P0 and P2.

5. **Reprocessing**:
   - C1 starts consuming from the last committed offset for P2.
   - The message that C3 was processing is reprocessed by C1.

### Example Workflow

1. **Initial Assignment**:
   - C1 -> P0
   - C2 -> P1
   - C3 -> P2

2. **Message Processing**:
   - C1 processes and commits offsets for P0.
   - C2 processes and commits offsets for P1.
   - C3 processes a message from P2 but crashes before committing the offset.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Kafka detects the failure of C3.
   - Kafka reassigns P2 to C1 or C2 (let's assume C1).

4. **Reprocessing**:
   - C1 starts consuming from the last committed offset for P2.
   - The message that C3 was processing is reprocessed by C1.

### Summary

- **Independent Consumers**: Each consumer maintains its own offsets. If a consumer crashes, it will resume from the last committed offset upon restart.
- **Consumer Groups**: Kafka ensures that each partition is consumed by only one consumer at a time. If a consumer crashes, Kafka rebalances the partitions among the remaining consumers, and the new consumer will reprocess any uncommitted messages.

In both scenarios, Kafka ensures that messages are not lost and are eventually processed, either by the same consumer upon restart or by another consumer in the group.

Q: when you say kafka remove the message from the queue after a consumer commits the offset, do you mean the message is removed from memory or from disk store?

When a consumer commits an offset in Kafka, it does not mean that the message is removed from either memory or disk storage. Instead, committing an offset is a way for the consumer to inform Kafka that it has successfully processed messages up to a certain point. The messages themselves remain in the Kafka log for a specified retention period, regardless of whether they have been consumed and acknowledged.

### Key Points to Understand:

1. **Message Retention**: Kafka retains messages for a configurable retention period, which can be based on time (e.g., 7 days) or log size (e.g., 100 GB). This retention policy is independent of whether the messages have been consumed and acknowledged.
2. **Offset Management**: Offsets are used to track the position of a consumer in a partition. When a consumer commits an offset, it is essentially recording the last message it has successfully processed.
3. **Message Storage**: Messages are stored in Kafka's log segments on disk. These log segments are only deleted according to the configured retention policy, not based on consumer acknowledgments.

### What Happens When a Consumer Commits an Offset?

- **Offset Commit**: When a consumer commits an offset, it updates the offset in Kafka's internal storage (typically in a special topic called `__consumer_offsets`). This indicates the highest offset that the consumer has successfully processed.
- **Message Retention**: The actual messages remain in the Kafka log until they are deleted according to the retention policy. This means that even after a consumer commits an offset, the messages are still available in Kafka for other consumers or for reprocessing if needed.

### Example Workflow

1. **Message Production**: A producer sends messages to a Kafka topic. These messages are appended to the log segments on disk.
2. **Message Consumption**: A consumer reads messages from the topic and processes them.
3. **Offset Commit**: After processing the messages, the consumer commits the offset to Kafka, indicating the highest offset it has processed.
4. **Message Retention**: The messages remain in the Kafka log until they are deleted according to the retention policy.

### Example Configuration

Here’s an example of how you might configure the retention policy for a Kafka topic:

```properties
# Retain messages for 7 days
log.retention.hours=168

# Retain messages until the log size reaches 100 GB
log.retention.bytes=107374182400
```

### Summary

- **Offset Commit**: When a consumer commits an offset, it updates the offset in Kafka's internal storage to indicate the highest offset it has processed.
- **Message Retention**: Messages remain in the Kafka log until they are deleted according to the configured retention policy, regardless of whether they have been consumed and acknowledged.
- **Message Storage**: Messages are stored in log segments on disk and are not removed based on consumer acknowledgments.

By understanding these concepts, you can better manage message consumption and retention in Kafka, ensuring that messages are available for reprocessing or for other consumers as needed.

Q: how to understand the exactly-once message delivery in kafka?

Exactly-once message delivery in Apache Kafka is a guarantee that each message will be delivered to the consumer exactly once, even in the presence of failures. This is a crucial feature for applications that require strong consistency and cannot tolerate duplicate or lost messages. Here's a detailed explanation of how exactly-once semantics (EOS) is achieved in Kafka:

### Key Concepts

1. **Idempotent Producer**:
   - Kafka producers can be configured to be idempotent, meaning they can send the same message multiple times without causing duplicates.
   - This is achieved by assigning a unique sequence number to each message sent by the producer. Kafka brokers use these sequence numbers to ensure that each message is written to the log exactly once.

2. **Transactions**:
   - Kafka supports transactions, allowing a group of messages to be sent atomically. This means either all messages in the transaction are successfully written to the log, or none are.
   - Transactions ensure that a series of operations (like producing messages to multiple partitions or topics) are completed as a single unit of work.

3. **Consumer Offsets**:
   - Consumer offsets are stored in a special Kafka topic called `__consumer_offsets`.
   - With EOS, consumer offsets are committed as part of the transaction, ensuring that messages are processed exactly once.

### How Exactly-Once Semantics Work

1. **Producer Side**:
   - Enable idempotence by setting `enable.idempotence=true` in the producer configuration.
   - Use transactions by starting a transaction, sending messages, and then committing the transaction.

2. **Broker Side**:
   - Brokers keep track of the sequence numbers for each producer to ensure idempotent message delivery.
   - Brokers handle the atomicity of transactions, ensuring that either all messages in a transaction are written or none are.

3. **Consumer Side**:
   - Consumers read messages and process them.
   - Offsets are committed as part of the transaction, ensuring that if a consumer crashes, it will not reprocess messages that were already processed.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how to configure a Kafka producer and consumer for exactly-once semantics:

#### Producer Configuration

```python
from confluent_kafka import Producer

producer_config = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'enable.idempotence': True,
    'acks': 'all',
    'transactional.id': 'my-transactional-id'
}

producer = Producer(producer_config)
producer.init_transactions()

try:
    producer.begin_transaction()
    producer.produce('my-topic', key='key1', value='value1')
    producer.produce('my-topic', key='key2', value='value2')
    producer.commit_transaction()
except Exception as e:
    producer.abort_transaction()
    print(f"Transaction failed: {e}")
```

#### Consumer Configuration

```python
from confluent_kafka import Consumer

consumer_config = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'group.id': 'my-group',
    'enable.auto.commit': False,
    'isolation.level': 'read_committed'
}

consumer = Consumer(consumer_config)
consumer.subscribe(['my-topic'])

while True:
    msg = consumer.poll(1.0)
    if msg is None:
        continue
    if msg.error():
        print(f"Consumer error: {msg.error()}")
        continue

    print(f"Consumed message {msg.key()}: {msg.value()}")
    consumer.commit(msg)
```

### Summary

- **Idempotent Producer**: Ensures each message is written exactly once.
- **Transactions**: Allow atomic writes of multiple messages.
- **Consumer Offsets**: Committed as part of the transaction to ensure exactly-once processing.

By configuring both the producer and consumer correctly, Kafka can provide exactly-once semantics, ensuring strong consistency and reliability in message delivery.
