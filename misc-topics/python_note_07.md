Q: how to convert a json file into a yaml file in python?

You can easily convert a JSON file to a YAML file in Python using the `json` and `yaml` libraries. First, you need to install the `pyyaml` package if you don't have it already.

### Installation
To install `pyyaml`, run:
```sh
pip install pyyaml
```

### Example Code
Here's a step-by-step example to convert a JSON file into a YAML file.

1. **Read the JSON file.**
2. **Convert the JSON data to a YAML format.**
3. **Write the YAML data to a file.**

Below is the complete code example:

```python
import json
import yaml

# File paths
json_file_path = 'input.json'
yaml_file_path = 'output.yaml'

# Read the JSON file
with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
    json_data = json.load(json_file)

# Convert JSON data to YAML format
yaml_data = yaml.dump(json_data, default_flow_style=False)

# Write the YAML data to a file
with open(yaml_file_path, 'w') as yaml_file:
    yaml_file.write(yaml_data)

print(f"Successfully converted {json_file_path} to {yaml_file_path}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - `json` library to read the JSON file.
   - `yaml` library to write data to a YAML file.

2. **Read the JSON File:**
   - Use `json.load(json_file)` to load the JSON data from the file.

3. **Convert JSON to YAML:**
   - Use `yaml.dump(json_data)` to convert the dictionary containing JSON data to a YAML-formatted string.
   - `default_flow_style=False` ensures that the YAML output will be more human-readable and not in a compact style.

4. **Write to YAML File:**
   - Open the target file (`output.yaml`) in write mode and write the YAML-formatted string to it.

### Example JSON file content (input.json):
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "is_employee": true,
  "address": {
    "street": "1234 Elm St",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "IL"
  },
  "favorites": [
    "reading",
    "hiking",
    "coding"
  ]
}
```

### Example YAML file content (output.yaml):
```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
is_employee: true
address:
  street: 1234 Elm St
  city: Springfield
  state: IL
favorites:
- reading
- hiking
- coding
```

By running the provided Python code, the JSON file `input.json` is read and then converted into a YAML file `output.yaml`. This conversion process can handle nested JSON structures and arrays seamlessly.
