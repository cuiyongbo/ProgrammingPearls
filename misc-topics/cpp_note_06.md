Q: tell me how C++ lambda function is implemented under the hood?

In C++, lambda functions are implemented as instances of anonymous function objects (also known as closures). Under the hood, the compiler translates a lambda expression into a class with an overloaded `operator()`. This class can capture variables from its surrounding scope either by value or by reference. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

### Example Lambda Function

Consider the following lambda expression:

```cpp
auto lambda = [x](int y) { return x + y; };
```

### Compiler-Generated Implementation

This lambda might be translated by the compiler into an implementation resembling the following:

1. **Class Declaration**: The lambda expression translates into an anonymous class with a `operator()` representing the function call.

```cpp
class __lambda_123456 {
public:
    // Constructor to initialize the captured variable
    __lambda_123456(int captured_x) : x(captured_x) {}

    // Overloaded function call operator
    int operator()(int y) const {
        return x + y;
    }

private:
    // Captured variable
    int x;
};
```

2. **Lambda Instance**: The lambda expression itself (`auto lambda = [x](int y) { return x + y; };`) corresponds to creating an instance of the compiler-generated class, initializing the captured variables.

```cpp
int captured_x = x;
__lambda_123456 lambda(captured_x);
```

### Captures

Different capture methods affect how variables are stored within the generated class:

- **By Value**: Copies of captured variables are stored within the class.
  ```cpp
  auto lambda = [=](int y) { return x + y; };
  ```

  Translated to:

  ```cpp
  class __lambda_by_value {
  public:
      __lambda_by_value(int captured_x) : x(captured_x) {}
      int operator()(int y) const { return x + y; }
  private:
      int x; // Copy of captured variable
  };
  ```

- **By Reference**: References to captured variables are stored within the class.
  ```cpp
  auto lambda = [&](int y) { return x + y; };
  ```

  Translated to:

  ```cpp
  class __lambda_by_reference {
  public:
      __lambda_by_reference(int& captured_x) : x(captured_x) {}
      int operator()(int y) const { return x + y; }
  private:
      int& x; // Reference to captured variable
  };
  ```

### Mutable Lambdas

If a lambda includes the `mutable` keyword, it allows modification of captured variables (by value) within its body:

```cpp
auto lambda = [x]() mutable { x += 1; };
```

Corresponds to adding non-const `operator()` in the generated class:

```cpp
class __lambda_mutable {
public:
    __lambda_mutable(int captured_x) : x(captured_x) {}
    void operator()() {
        x += 1;
        // Capture x is modifiable
    }
private:
    int x; // Copy of captured variable
};
```

### Summary

In summary, C++ lambdas are syntactic sugar for creating anonymous function objects (closures). The compiler generates a class and an instance of that class, with appropriate function call operators and member variables to handle captured state. The transformation involves:

- Creating an anonymous class with an `operator()`.
- Capturing variables by value or by reference as member variables.
- Initializing these member variables through a constructor.

This allows lambdas to encapsulate their surrounding state and provide inline, concise function definitions.


Q: can a lambda function be called in a recusive way? and why if not?

In C++, a lambda function can indeed be called in a recursive manner. However, standard lambda syntax does not directly support self-referencing for recursion. To achieve recursion with lambdas, you need to handle the self-reference manually. There are a few common approaches to accomplish this:

### Approach 1: Using an External Function or Wrapper

You can define an external function or a wrapper around the lambda to facilitate recursive calls.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// A helper function to enable recursion with a lambda
std::function<int(int)> make_factorial() {
    return [](int n, std::function<int(int)> rec) -> int {
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        else return n * rec(n - 1, rec);
    };
}

int main() {
    std::function<int(int)> factorial;
    factorial = make_factorial();

    int result = factorial(5); // Calculates 5!
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Approach 2: Using `std::function`

You can directly use `std::function` to allow a lambda to refer to itself. This approach uses `std::function` to hold the lambda, enabling the lambda to capture and call itself recursively.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    // Define 'factorial' as a std::function that captures itself for recursion
    std::function<int(int)> factorial = [&factorial](int n) -> int {
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        else return n * factorial(n - 1);
    };

    int result = factorial(5); // Calculates 5!
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Approach 3: Using an Immediately Invoked Lambda Expression (IILE)

You can use an immediately invoked lambda expression to pass the lambda to itself as an argument.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Defines a recursive lambda using IILE
    auto factorial = [](auto&& self, int n) -> int {
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        else return n * self(self, n - 1);
    };

    int result = factorial(factorial, 5); // Calculates 5!
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5 is " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

// g++ scaffold.cpp -std=c++14
```

### Why Standard Lambdas Don't Directly Support Recursion

Standard lambda syntax does not inherently provide a way for the lambda to reference itself by name because:
1. **Uniqueness**: Each lambda has a unique, unnamed type that does not have a predefined name or identifier within its own scope.
2. **Simplicity**: Lambdas are designed to be simple and concise, typically for use in small, non-recursive tasks or as short inline functions.

By using the approaches described above, you can achieve recursion with lambdas effectively, allowing for self-referential behavior where necessary.


Q: what's the difference between std::function and lambda function in C++?
In C++, `std::function` and lambda functions serve different purposes, and understanding their differences is key to using them effectively. Here is a detailed comparison of the two:

### Lambda Functions

#### Characteristics:
1. **Syntax and Definition**:
   - Lambda functions provide a concise way to define anonymous function objects directly within the expression. 
   - They are often used for short, ephemeral functionality such as callbacks or small algorithms.

   ```cpp
   auto lambda = [](int x, int y) { return x + y; };
   int result = lambda(3, 4); // result is 7
   ```

2. **Performance**:
   - Since lambda functions are converted into instances of compiler-generated classes, they are often more efficient. 
   - They can be inlined by the compiler, leading to minimal overhead.
   - Capturing behavior can be fine-tuned for performance (by value or by reference).

3. **Type**:
   - Lambdas have unique, unnamed types generated by the compiler.
   - These types include the captured state, and they are not polymorphic (i.e., you cannot easily store different lambda types in a container without type erasures, such as `std::function`).

#### Example:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](int x) { return x * 2; };

// Lambda's type is unique and not exposed; `lambda` holds an instance of this type.
```

### `std::function`

#### Characteristics:
1. **Syntax and Definition**:
   - `std::function` is a type-erased, polymorphic wrapper for callable objects (functions, functors, lambdas).
   - It can store any callable object targeting a function with a specific signature.

   ```cpp
   std::function<int(int, int)> func = [](int x, int y) { return x + y; };
   int result = func(3, 4); // result is 7
   ```

2. **Flexibility**:
   - `std::function` can hold different kinds of callable objects, from regular functions and function pointers to lambdas and other function objects.
   - This makes it highly versatile for use cases involving dynamic dispatch or higher-order functions.

3. **Performance**:
   - `std::function` introduces some overhead due to type erasure and dynamic allocations, especially if the encapsulated callable object is large or involves captures.
   - It usually has more overhead than direct calls to lambda functions or functors.

4. **Type**:
   - `std::function` has a known, fixed type, which is defined by the signature of the callable it wraps.
   - This polymorphism allows it to be stored in containers, passed around, and assigned different callable objects at runtime.

#### Example:
```cpp
std::function<int(int)> func = [](int x) { return x * 2; };

// `func` can hold any callable object matching the signature `int(int)`, such as
// regular functions, lambdas, function pointers, etc.
```

### Summary of Differences

- **Lambda Function**:
  - Provides a concise way to define inline function objects.
  - Typically more efficient and can be inlined by the compiler.
  - Has a unique, compiler-generated type.
  - Capturing semantics (by value or by reference) are fine-tuned.
  
- **`std::function`**:
  - Provides polymorphic storage for any callable object with a specific signature.
  - More flexible and can hold various callable types, including lambdas, functions, and function pointers.
  - Introduces overhead due to type erasure and potential dynamic allocations.
  - Has a fixed, known type based on the signature it wraps, making it suitable for certain patterns requiring type erasure and dynamic dispatch.

Choosing between a lambda and `std::function` depends on the specific use case: prefer lambdas for performance-sensitive, type-specific, and inline cases, and use `std::function` when flexibility, type erasure, or polymorphism is needed.

Q: what is type erasure about?

Type erasure is a programming technique used to abstract away specific types and provide a uniform interface. This allows code to handle objects of different types in a consistent manner without knowing or depending on the concrete types at compile time. Type erasure is particularly useful in designing libraries or APIs that need to work with a wide range of types while providing a single, generic interface.

### Key Concepts

1. **Uniform Interface**: Type erasure allows creating a common interface that can be used to interact with various types uniformly.

2. **Hiding Types**: The concrete type of the object is "erased" or hidden behind an abstract or generic interface. The specific type is not known at the interface level.

3. **Runtime Polymorphism**: Type erasure typically involves some form of runtime polymorphism. This allows different types to be used interchangeably through a common interface.

### Example in C++

A practical example of type erasure in C++ is the standard library's `std::function`. This template class can hold any callable object (such as function pointers, lambdas, and functors) and provide a uniform interface to call them.

#### `std::function`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// A function to demonstrate using std::function
void example(std::function<int(int)> func) {
    std::cout << "Result: " << func(5) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Lambda function
    auto lambda = [](int x) { return x * 2; };

    // std::function type-erases the lambda's specific type
    std::function<int(int)> func = lambda;

    // Passing the type-erased function object
    example(func);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `std::function<int(int)>` provides a uniform interface to any callable that matches the signature `int(int)`.
- The lambda's specific type is erased, allowing it to be stored in `std::function` and called via the common interface.

### Type Erasure Components

To manually implement type erasure, we typically use a combination of:
- Abstract base class or interface
- Templates to capture any type
- Virtual functions to provide a common interface

#### Manual Implementation Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <utility>

// Abstract base class for type-erased function holder
struct FunctionBase {
    virtual ~FunctionBase() = default;
    virtual int invoke(int) = 0;
};

// Template derived class holding the actual callable object
template <typename Callable>
struct FunctionHolder : FunctionBase {
    Callable callable;
    FunctionHolder(Callable&& c) : callable(std::forward<Callable>(c)) {}
    int invoke(int arg) override { return callable(arg); }
};

// Type-erased wrapper class
class Function {
    std::unique_ptr<FunctionBase> holder;

public:
    template <typename Callable>
    Function(Callable&& c) : holder(std::make_unique<FunctionHolder<Callable>>(std::forward<Callable>(c))) {}

    int operator()(int arg) { return holder->invoke(arg); }
};

int main() {
    // Using the type-erased Function class with a lambda
    Function f = [](int x) { return x * 2; };
    std::cout << "Result: " << f(5) << std::endl; // Result: 10

    return 0;
}
```

In this manual implementation:
- `FunctionBase` is an abstract base class with a virtual `invoke` method.
- `FunctionHolder` is a template class that holds the actual callable object and implements the `invoke` method.
- `Function` is the type-erased wrapper class that holds a `std::unique_ptr` to `FunctionBase`.

The type-erased `Function` class can store any callable object and provide a uniform way to invoke it via the `operator()`.

### Benefits of Type Erasure
- **Generic Programming**: Enables writing generic code that can work with any type, enhancing code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Provides runtime polymorphism without the need for inheritance hierarchies.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples code from specific types, making it more modular and flexible.

### Drawbacks of Type Erasure
- **Performance Overhead**: Type erasure can introduce runtime overhead due to dynamic allocations and virtual function calls.
- **Complexity**: Implementing type erasure can be more complex compared to using statically typed solutions.
- **Loss of Compile-Time Checking**: Type erasure can sometimes lead to loss of compile-time type checking, resulting in potential runtime errors.

Type erasure is a powerful technique that enhances the flexibility and expressiveness of C++ by enabling uniform treatment of different types through a common interface.
