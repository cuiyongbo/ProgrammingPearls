## how many weights in GPT-3?

GPT-3, developed by OpenAI, is a large-scale language model with a significant number of parameters. Specifically, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters. These parameters include weights and biases that are learned during the training process.

To give you a sense of scale, here is a comparison with its predecessors:

- GPT-1: 117 million parameters
- GPT-2: 1.5 billion parameters
- GPT-3: 175 billion parameters

The sheer number of parameters in GPT-3 allows it to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks with high accuracy, but it also requires substantial computational resources for both training and inference.

## can you decouple the weight sources in GPT-3?

Decoupling the weight sources in GPT-3, or any large neural network model, typically involves understanding and separating the different components and types of weights used within the model. In the context of GPT-3, the weights can be broadly categorized based on the architecture of the Transformer model it uses. Here’s a high-level breakdown:

### 1. **Embedding Weights**
   - **Token Embeddings**: These weights map input tokens (words or subwords) to dense vectors.
   - **Positional Embeddings**: These weights encode the position of each token in the sequence, allowing the model to understand the order of tokens.

### 2. **Transformer Block Weights**
   GPT-3 consists of multiple Transformer blocks, each containing several types of weights:
   - **Self-Attention Weights**: These include query, key, and value matrices that are used to compute attention scores.
   - **Feed-Forward Network Weights**: These include weights for the linear transformations before and after the activation functions within each block.
   - **Layer Normalization Weights**: These include scale and shift parameters used in layer normalization layers.

### 3. **Output Weights**
   - **Final Linear Layer Weights**: These weights map the final hidden states to the vocabulary space, producing logits for each token in the vocabulary.

### Example of Decoupling Weights in Code
While you cannot directly access GPT-3's weights without the model itself, here’s a conceptual example of how you might decouple weights in a Transformer model using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model, nhead, num_layers):
        super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        self.positional_encoding = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 512, d_model))
        self.transformer_blocks = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model, nhead) for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(d_model, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x) + self.positional_encoding[:, :x.size(1), :]
        for block in self.transformer_blocks:
            x = block(x)
        x = self.output_layer(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
model = TransformerModel(vocab_size=30522, d_model=768, nhead=12, num_layers=12)

# Accessing different weight sources
embedding_weights = model.embedding.weight
positional_encoding_weights = model.positional_encoding
transformer_block_weights = [block.state_dict() for block in model.transformer_blocks]
output_layer_weights = model.output_layer.weight

print("Embedding Weights:", embedding_weights.shape)
print("Positional Encoding Weights:", positional_encoding_weights.shape)
print("Transformer Block Weights:", len(transformer_block_weights))
print("Output Layer Weights:", output_layer_weights.shape)
```

In this example:
- `embedding_weights` contains the token embedding weights.
- `positional_encoding_weights` contains the positional encoding weights.
- `transformer_block_weights` is a list of state dictionaries for each Transformer block, containing self-attention and feed-forward network weights.
- `output_layer_weights` contains the weights of the final linear layer.

This conceptual breakdown helps in understanding the different sources of weights in a Transformer model like GPT-3. However, accessing and manipulating the actual weights of GPT-3 would require access to the model itself, which is proprietary to OpenAI.

```py
d_embed = 12288
n_vocab = 50257
d_key = 128
d_query = 128
d_value = 128
n_heads = 96
n_layers = 96
n_neurons = 4 * d_embed
```

Total weights: `617558016+14495514624+14495514624+14495514624+14495514624+57982058496+57982058496+617558016 = 175181291520`, about 175 billion
